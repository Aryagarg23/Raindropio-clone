# Raindropio-clone

## Project Overview

Raindropio-clone is a collaborative bookmarking and knowledge organization platform. Phase 1 focuses on Google SSO authentication, team membership, and admin operations using Supabase, FastAPI, and Next.js.

**Current Status**: Actively refactoring large monolithic components into smaller, maintainable modules. Major progress made in breaking down the 3,487-line team site page into focused components.

## Goals
- Google SSO authentication via Supabase
- Team management and membership
- Admin panel for user/team management
- Secure backend with RLS and service role
- Cloud-only setup (Supabase/Postgres, buckets)
- **Maintainable codebase** with modular architecture and proper separation of concerns
